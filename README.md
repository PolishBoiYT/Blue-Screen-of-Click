# Blue Screen of *click* POOF!
A game i made which "does a *POOF!*" and bluescreens your computer... or so you think... as clicking the background increases the counter!

# Usage i guess
just click the background and get the percentage to 100!
it will show a msgbox and the bsod background will change to black! with the support person text being replaced with well. my website since i worked HARD on it.

# click click clickity click
click

# Nice game! where can i support you?
idk

# How can i make my own version?
simply install git and enter this command or if you have GitHub desktop then do the one under the git command.
```Git
git clone https://github.com/nSwishBall/Blue-Screen-of-Click.git
```
Click on Set up in desktop if you use GitHub desktop.
